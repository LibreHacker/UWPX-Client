# Privacy Policy

## General
UWPX is an XMPP client, that connects to XMPP servers.
It does not collect any personal data and all ways data is collected can be disabled.

## Crash reporting
After a crash, the App will collect data about what happened and uploads this bundle to [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) or for versions lower than [v.0.6.0.0](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.6.0.0) to [HockeyApp](https://hockeyapp.net/features/crashreports/).  
Although it's not recommended, it can be disabled via `Settings` -> `Misc` -> `Disable crash reporting`.

## Analytics
Since version [`0.11.0.0`](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.11.0.0) UWPX uses [AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms) [Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/analytics/) to report basic information like session count, duration and which OS version you are running on.
Like Crash Reporting, Analytics can be disabled via `Settings` -> `Misc` -> `Disable analytics`.

## Accounts
XMPP accounts you add, get stored in a local [SQLite-net database](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net). This database is located in the apps [ApplicationData](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.applicationdata) folder, where by design no other applications have access to.  
The password for each account gets stored in a [PasswordVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.security.credentials.passwordvault) ([implementation](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/blob/master/Data_Manager2/Classes/Vault.cs)).  
Passwords for [MUC](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html)s and all [OMEMO](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) keys get stored in plain text in the above mentioned database.

## Picture library
The App accesses your picture library to store downloaded images.  
This can be disabled via `Settings` -> `Chat` -> `Store images in library`.  
If disabled, the app will store all newly downloaded images in the local app directory.

## General filesystem
UWPX accesses to the general file system only in case **you** want to export logs (`Settings` -> `Misc` -> `Export logs`).

## Bluetooth
Since version [`0.20.0.0`](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.20.0.0) UWPX uses Bluetooth to connect and register new experimental XMPP IoT devices.

## Webcam
Since version [`0.20.0.0`](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.20.0.0) UWPX can use your webcam to scan XMPP realted Qr-Codes. This is used for scanning/validating OMEMO fingerprints and experimental XMPP IoT setup QR-Codes.

## Push Server
Since version [`0.35.0.0`](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.35.0.0) UWPX uses an external [push server](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Push-Server#uwpx-push-server). This push server [stores](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Push-Server#what-the-push-server-stores) data persistent. Besides that, no [direct identifiers](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Push-Server#update-push-accounts) for accounts will be stored persistent. Logging in a productive environment is reduced to a minimal and will not contain personal information.

### GPDR
European GDPR allows users to request a copy of all data retained about them. Please send GDPR requests to [gpdr@uwpx.org](mailto:gpdr@uwpx.org).
Before we can comply with your request, we will ask you to send additional information to a specific JID so we can identify you, since UWPX and the push server does **not** save any direct links to your or your JID.
